KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM

1. Remove all loops and parallel edges
2.Arrange all edges in their increasing order of weight
3. Add the edge which has the least weightage
4. Leave the edge if it forms loop
5. Repeat 3 and 4 until all edges are covered


PRIM'S ALGORITHM

1. Remove all loops and parallel edges
2. Choose any arbitrary node as root node
3. Check outgoing edges and select the one with less cost.
