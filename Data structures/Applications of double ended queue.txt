Applications:
1. Palindrome check
2. Steal Job scheduling algorithm
      - The steal algorithm implements task scheduling for several process(Multiprocess scheduling)
      - Each processor has a deque linked to it.
      - If the process completes the execution of its own queue, it pull the thread from the rear end of other processor and executes it.
3. Undo-Redo operations in software applications.
