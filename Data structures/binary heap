BINARY HEAP TREE

      Binary heap tree is a complete binary tree except at the last level. At the last level all its elements are towards left. 
      It is implemented using arrays. Inserting in heap tree is adding elements to the next position and so on. On inserting an element,
      we do heapify up. That is , the last element added is compared with its parent , if it is max, swap or move up and repeat. 
      Delete- deleting the root.Here we make last element as root and decrements the size and do heapify down.
      The root is compared with its child that is max. If root is max move down and repeat or else swap, move down and repeat.
